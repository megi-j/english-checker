        <p class="text">
            I was born in Peru, but I spent my first years in Bolivia. Since then, I’ve lived in many other countries,
            but I still think that my Peruvian roots are very important to me. The kind of Spanish I speak is the
            Peruvian Spanish and, in this sense, I am a Peruvian writer. But I am not nationalistic. For me being
            born in Peru is as important as spending so many years in other countries. I think the places in which
            I’ve lived have produced the writer that I am. Nationalistic vision is so limited! What you discover
            while reading authors in different languages is that the common viewpoints are much larger than 
            nationalistic ones! It’s very important to liberate yourself from nationalism and I think literature
            written in different languages helps you to overcome this very limited view of life. So, in this sense,
            I consider myself a citizen of the world and I think literature has helped me very much to have this attitude.

        <p class="text">
            In my childhood I had a dream to be a writer, but this seemed totally impossible then. This was because
            at that time most Latin American writers had some other professions - they were either doctors or 
            diplomats and writing literature was only a weekend hobby for them. I didn’t want to be this kind of writer.
            I enjoyed reading very much and I thought that a life completely focused on inventing and telling stories 
            would be absolutely fantastic. Then I learnt that there was a city in which it was apparently possible to 
            be only a writer, and that was Paris! So, being still very young, I thought that I should organise my life
            so that I was able to reach Paris. When I finished university, I got a grant and moved to Madrid to work 13
            on my doctorate degree and then, after one year, I moved to Paris. I was very lucky, because that was what 
            I’d been dreaming about since childhood – to devote all my time to writing. In Paris, I was able to organise
            my life so that I could concentrate on reading and writing. I finished my first and second novels there and 
            was writing the third one when I moved from Paris to London, where I went to teach Latin American and Spanish
            literature. I enjoyed living in London, because the teaching job I had there allowed me to have a lot of free
            time for writing. So, I can say that I became a real writer in Paris, in London, in Europe.

            I, of course, had the models of great writers. Very important for me was the case of a French novelist 
            Gustave Flaubert. There were writers who became successful because they were born with a natural talent. 
            This was not the case with Flaubert. I’ve read a lot about his life and I discovered that, when Flaubert 
            started writing, he was not a genius at all. He achieved success through hard work, discipline and a strong 
            wish to be a good writer. I’ve admired Flaubert since I read his first novel Madame Bovary. His originality, 
            his talent was achieved through deep commitment to what he wanted to achieve; I felt that I was not a genius 
            at all and Flaubert’s example taught me that if I wanted to write good books, I had to work hard.
